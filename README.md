# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# About ChaosCease

Do you ever find yourself wanting to plan things out or jot down something really important? Are you someone deeply invested in the digital world, aiming to reduce the use of paper? Well, meet ChaosCease! ChaosCease is a task management tool designed to help users plan their day, take notes, and much more! Just by looking at the name, it can “cease” the “chaos” of people who are overwhelmed with their busy life. In fact, the pronunciation of “cease” which is like the term “seas” symbolizes calmness, much like the serene seas, for the app user.

## What it does

Our project helps users stay motivated and on track within prioritizing their well-being. Although this project mainly falls under the category of productivity tools, it significantly contributes to every part of the area of well-being in terms of mental, physical, or social. 

Here is why: 

1. Our app ensures the mental well being of the user by allowing users to organize their tasks and prioritize them. Having a clear list of tasks can alleviate the mental burden of trying to remember everything, leading to reduced stress and improved mental well-being. 

2. While a to-do app itself doesn't directly impact physical well-being, it can indirectly contribute by helping users plan and schedule physical activities such as workouts, walks, or other forms of exercise. By managing tasks efficiently, users can make time for physical activities, thereby promoting physical well-being. 

3. For social well-being, again, a to-do app doesn't directly impact social well-being, but it can indirectly contribute by helping users manage their social commitments. By organizing social events, meetups, or even reminders to connect with friends and family, the app can aid users in maintaining their social relationships, thereby supporting social well-being. We made sure that our app is the most beneficial for each and every user, prioritizing their every type of well-being!
